Game Description: 
* How to play:
   * Run final_project
   * Create a variable = to hangman() example: g = hangman()
   * Do g.playGame() to play the game & run the menu
   * Choose the choice from the menu you’d like. To play the game choose 1
* How our AI plays:
   * When you run playGame(), the AI runs with it since it is called in the playGame()
   * There are three levels of AI difficulty that the player can choose from
      * Easy: the computer randomly guesses letters. 
      * Hard: the computer guesses higher probability letters. 
      * Expert: the computer knows the word! 




* Results:
* We successfully created a working hangman with an AI that has three levels of difficulty
* We grew as programmers + made our first game ever!!!
* Learned what a global variable was and how to use it in a class!!!!!! 
* Learned how frustrating debugging can be 
   * In the last week we spent 10 hours debugging :(( 




* Difficult Parts: 
   * We particularly struggled with implementing the AI as the regular hangman game was completed by the deadline for the milestone
   * We spent our last week and many hard working hours getting the AI to work correctly 
   * We also spent time cleaning up/rewriting our code with the help of grutoring
      * This allowed us to get cleaner code that would get the hangman game to run correctly


* If we had more time: 
   * We would work on figuring out easier and less tedious ways to implement what we did. 
   * We would add more levels of AI difficulty and possibly different variations of the hangman game.
